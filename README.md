# RsProlog

RsProlog is a new Rust interpreter for the (forsaken) Turing language, and is
intended to be a drop in replacement for TProlog, the older interpreter.


## Why

- Curiosity. Just pure curiosity
- Learning about compilers and bytecode virtual machines
- Learning about concurrency and parallelism
- Learning about JIT and interpreters
- Big projects like this are "fun" to play with
- The current "situation" gives me time to play with

Do not expect this project to be maintained for a long time.


## Building

To build the rsprolog executable:
```
git clone https://github.com/DropDemBits/rsprolog.git
